## Problem 1

### part a

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
### The first table: reporting the mean and median departure delay per airport.
dep_delay_per_airport <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest)%>%
  filter(n() >= 10) %>% # Filter out destinations with fewer than 10 flights
  summarize(mean_del_time=mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            median_del_time=median(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_del_time))
head(dep_delay_per_airport,10)
```

```{r}
### The second table: reporting the mean and median arrival delay per airport. 
arrival_delay_per_airport <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest)%>%
  filter(n() >= 10) %>% # Filter out destinations with fewer than 10 flights
  summarize(mean_del_time=mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            median_del_time=median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_del_time))
head(arrival_delay_per_airport,10)
```

### part b

Flight No.1499 is the fastest flight, with a average speed of 703.3846 MPH and a total number of flights of 397 times.

```{r}
### Find out the flight with fastest average speed in MPH and display the flight number.
fatest_avg_speed <- flights %>%
  summarize(avg_speed=distance/(air_time/60),
            flight_no=flight) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_speed))
head(fatest_avg_speed)
```

```{r}
num_flights <- flights %>%
  group_by(flight) %>%
  summarize(avg_speed=distance/(air_time/60), #calculate the average speed in MPH since the air_time is in miniutes.
            count=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_speed))
head(num_flights,1)
```
